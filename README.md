# 🔢 NumPy Sprint – AI/ML Foundations

This repository documents my **NumPy sprint**, as part of my **AI/ML Engineer roadmap**.  
Goal: Build a strong understanding of **NumPy arrays, operations, and real-world applications**, including working with image data.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
- **Python 3.12+**
- **VS Code** (with Python extension)
- **Git** for version control
- **Jupyter Notebook** (via Anaconda)
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

---

## 📌 Learning Path (4 Phases)

### **Phase 1 – NumPy Foundation**
- Introduction to NumPy  
- Array creation (`np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`)  
- Array attributes (shape, size, dtype, ndim)  
- Basic methods (`reshape`, `flatten`, `astype`)  

---

### **Phase 2 – Operations on NumPy Arrays**
- Indexing & slicing  
- Vectorized operations (+, -, *, /, **)  
- Broadcasting  
- Universal functions (ufuncs)  
- Matrix operations (`dot`, `transpose`, `inverse`)  

---

### **Phase 3 – Practice with Real-World Data**
- Load CSV data with NumPy (`genfromtxt`, `loadtxt`)  
- Perform basic statistics (`mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `argmax`, `argmin`)  
- Simple data cleaning with NumPy  
- Visualization with Matplotlib  

---

### **Phase 4 – Image as Array**
- Load image into NumPy array  
- Convert image into grayscale/dark mode by manipulating pixel values  
- Save and display transformed images  


## 🎯 Goals
- Complete **NumPy in focused sprints**.  
- Practice with **real datasets** and **image processing**.  
- Build a solid numerical computing base for AI/ML.

## 📈 Motivation
> “One day of intense focus can replace weeks of scattered effort.”
